OBal - options balance

I'm a customer of Interactive Brokers (http://www.interactivebrokers.com/)
and mainly write options there. To keep track of my profit/loss I wrote OBal
(short for "options balance").

The software is currently not end-user friendly. You may have to know Perl
to use it.

import.pl - read orders.csv (Activity Flex - full detail) into database
script/obal_server.pl - start web application (http://localhost:3000/)

stock-prices.pl has to look like this:
{MSFT => 24, GOOG => 510};


TODO:
- currency support
- cash trade support
- combination support
- stock prices editable in web frontend
- import stock prices from Yahoo! or Google Finance
